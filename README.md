# Behaviour-and-Content-Simulation
Behaviour and content simulation challenge was proposed by Adobe where the task was to predict the number of likes on a given twitter post having media files, date of post, company, and content. This is the behaviour simulation task. The Content simulation task is to generate the content of the post using the media files.
